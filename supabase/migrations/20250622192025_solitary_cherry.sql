/*
  # Fix array_length JSONB error

  1. Problem
    - PostgreSQL function `array_length` is being used on JSONB column `answers`
    - This causes "function array_length(jsonb, integer) does not exist" error
    - Affects competition participant data fetching and quiz completion

  2. Solution
    - Replace incorrect `array_length(answers, 1)` with `jsonb_object_keys(answers)` count
    - Update any triggers or functions that use array_length on JSONB columns
    - Ensure proper handling of answers column which stores question-answer pairs as JSONB

  3. Changes
    - Update save_competition_result function to properly handle JSONB answers
    - Fix any RLS policies that might be using array_length incorrectly
    - Ensure questions_answered is calculated correctly from JSONB object
